Program to simulate the operations of an E-Mart.

Two types of customers: Shoppers and Robbers

Program read in a list of customers (name, shopper/robber, arrival time, number of items to buy/steal), (2) run the simulation.  Output will be generated while the simulation is running.

Customers enters store at specified arrival time, spend time to shop for their items, get in line to pay/steal (robbers also wait in line to rob the store), spend some time paying or stealing money, and then leave the store.  When a customer performs an action (arrive in store, get in checkout line, start paying/stealing, finish paying/stealing), program will print a message documenting the customer's action and the current time.
