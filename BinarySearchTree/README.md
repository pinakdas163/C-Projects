Write a binary search tree class (called BST) that is a tree of C++ strings.  A binary search tree (BST), is a binary tree (two children) where for every node in the tree, all the values in the node's left subtree are less than the node's value and all the values in the node's right subtree are greater than the node's value.

Write a main.cpp that instantiates a BST object and reads and executes commands from standard input.
